## 1. How confident are you in checking the assumptions of the linear model with multiple predictors? 

## 2. How confident are you in understanding that the statistics remain the same when including multiple predictors in the linear model?

## 3. How confident are you translating the research question into parameters of the linear model with multiple predictors?

## 4. How confident are you in understanding that the research question can involve a combination of multiple model parameters? 

## 5. How confident are you in interpreting the results of the statistical analysis in terms of the research context?
