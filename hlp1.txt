< ## Data Exploration and Descriptive Statistics
< 
< - Data exploration is extremely important to get insight in the data. 
< - It is often underrated and overlooked. 
< 
< ### Descriptive statistics
< We first summarize the data and calculate the mean, standard deviation, number of observations and standard error and store the result in an object apRelSum via 'apRelSum<-`
< 
< 1. We pipe the `ap` dataframe to the group_by function to group the data by treatment trt `group_by(trt)`
< 2. We pipe the result to the `summarize_at` function to summarize the "rel" variable and calculate the mean, standard deviation and the number of observations 
< 3. We pipe the result to the `mutate` function to make a new variable in the data frame `se` for which we calculate the standard error 
< 
< 
< ```{r}
< apRelSum<-ap%>%
<   group_by(trt)%>%
<   summarize_at("rel",
<                list(mean=~mean(.,na.rm=TRUE),
<                     sd=~sd(.,na.rm=TRUE),
<                     n=function(x) x%>%is.na%>%`!`%>%sum)) %>%
<   mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n))
< 
< apRelSum
< ```
< 
< ---
< 
< ### Plots
< We will use ggplot2 to make our plots. 
< With the ggplot2 library we can easily build plots by adding layers.
< 
< #### barplot
< 
< 1. We pipe our summarized data to the `ggplot` function and we select the treatment variable trt and the variable mean for plotting `aes(x=trt,y=mean)`
< 
< 2. We make a barplot based on this data using the `geom_bar` function. The statistic is `stat="identity"` because the bar height should be equal the value for the mean of the relative abundance.
< 
< ```{r}
< apRelSum%>% 
<   ggplot(aes(x=trt,y=mean)) +
<   geom_bar(stat="identity") 
< ```
< 
< - Is this plot informative??
< 
< ---
< 
< We will now add standard errors to the plot
< using `geom_errorbar` function and specify the minimum and maximum value for of the error bar, the width command is used to set the width of the error bar smaller than the width of the bar. 
< 
< ```{r}
< apRelSum%>% 
<   ggplot(aes(x=trt,y=mean)) +
<   geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
<   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-se,ymax=mean+se),width=.2)
< ```
< 
< - Is this plot informative??
< 
< ---
< 
< #### boxplots
< 
< I consider barplots to be bad plots
< 
< - They are not informative
< - They just visualize a two point summary of the data. It is better to do this in a table
< - They use a lot of space (e.g. from zero up to the minimum relative abundance) where no data are present. 
< 
< It is better to get a view on the distribution of the data. We can use a boxplot for this purpose.
< We first explain what a boxplot. 
< 
< ---
< 
< ```{r fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
< fem <- NHANES::NHANES %>% filter(Gender=="female" & !is.na(DirectChol)) %>% select(DirectChol)
< boxplot(fem$DirectChol, ylab="Direct Cholestorol",cex.lab=1.5,cex.axis=1.5,cex.main=1.5)
< rangeCl<-quantile(fem$DirectChol,c(.25,.75))+c(-1,1)*diff(quantile(fem$DirectChol,c(.25,.75)))*1.5
< boxYs<-c(range(fem$DirectChol[fem$DirectChol<=rangeCl[2]&fem$DirectChol>=rangeCl[1]]),quantile(fem$DirectChol,c(.25,.5,.75)),rangeCl[2]+(max(fem$DirectChol)-rangeCl[2])/2)
< text(1.3,boxYs,labels=c("wisker","wisker","x25","mediaan","x75","outliers"),pos=4,cex=1.3)
< lines(c(1.1,1.3,1.3,1.1),c(rangeCl[2],rangeCl[2]+(max(fem$DirectChol)-rangeCl[2])/2,rangeCl[2]+(max(fem$DirectChol)-rangeCl[2])/2,max(fem$DirectChol)),lty=2)
< ```
< 
< ---
< 
< We will now make a boxplot for the ap data
< 
< 1. We pipe the `ap` dataframe to the ggplot command
< 2. We select the data with the command `ggplot(aes(x=trt,y=rel))`
< 3. We add a boxplot with the command `geom_boxplot()`
147,157c54
< ```{r}
< ap %>%  
<   ggplot(aes(x=trt,y=rel)) + 
<   geom_boxplot()
< ```
< 
< ---
<
