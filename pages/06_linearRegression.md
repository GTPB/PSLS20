# Linear regression tutorial

On the third day of the "Practical Statistics for the Life Sciences (2020)" course, we will have three tutorials on data linear regression, based on different datasets:

#### 1) Breast cancer dataset

- Exercise: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTPB/PSLS20/master/tutorialScripts/excercises/06_linearRegression/breastcancerExample.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTPB/PSLS20/master/tutorialScripts/excercises/06_linearRegression/breastcancerExample.Rmd)

#### 2) The fish dataset:

In this experiments 96 fish (dojofish, goldfish and zebrafish) were placed separately in a tank with two liters of water and
a certain dose (in mg) of a certain poison EI-43,064. The resistance of the fish a against the poison was measured as the amount of
minutes the fish survived upon adding the poison (Surv_time, in minutes). Additionally, the weightt of each fish was measured.

In this tutorial, we will study the association between dose and survival time by using a linear regression model.

 #### 3) The FEV dataset:

The FEV, which is an acronym for forced expiratory volume, is a measure of how much air a person can exhale during  a forced breath. 
In this dataset, the FEV of 606 children, between the ages of 6 and 17, were measured. The dataset also provides additional information on 
these children: their `age`, their `height`, their `gender` and, most importantly, whether the child is a smoker or a non-smoker.
The goal of this experiment was to find out whether or not smoking has an effect on the FEV of children.
